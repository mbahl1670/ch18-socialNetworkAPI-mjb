## Installation
npm install express mongoose

## Acceptance Criteria
* WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application\
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database
* WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts\
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
* WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia\
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a userâ€™s friend list

## Git Repository
https://github.com/mbahl1670/ch18-socialNetworkAPI-mjb

## How this was accomplished
*  Created the models for Users & Thoughts & sub-schema for Reactions in the Thought model
*  Created the Controller & Routes directories, starting with the User controller functions then connected them with routes
*  Created the server.js file, connecting all the models/routes/controller files
*  Tested the user routes/models to be sure they were working in Insomnia
*  Verified the friends feature was working with User referencing itself
*  Wrote the controller functions for Thoughts then connected them with routes, verified they were working in Insomnia
*  Finished up with the reactions to thoughts by adding addReaction, deleteReaction in the Thought controller file, verified they were working in insomnia
